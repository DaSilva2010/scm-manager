### Overview
The branches overview shows the branches that are already existing. By clicking on a branch, the details page of the branch is shown.

The tag "Default" shows which branch is currently set as the default branch of the repository in SCM-Manager. The default branch is always shown first when opening the repository in SCM-Manager.

The button "Create Branch" opens the form to create a new branch.
