### Overview
The user overview shows a list of all existing users. A page with details about a user can be accessed by clicking on the user. New users can be created with the "Create User" button.

### Create User
The "Create User" form can be used to create new users in SCM-Manager. New users donâ€™t have any permissions and should therefore be configured right after they were created.

### User Details Page
The user details page shows the information about the user.

The active box shows whether the user is able to use SCM-Manager. The external box shows if it is an internal user or whether it is managed by an external system.
