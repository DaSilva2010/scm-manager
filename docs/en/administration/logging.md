SCM-Manager logs information which can be useful, if the system does not behave as expected.
The logging behavior depends on your operating system and installation.

| Type of Installation | Logging |
|----------------------|---------|
| Docker | stdout |
| RPM | /var/log/scm |
| DEB | /var/log/scm |
| Unix | $BASEDIR/logs |
| Mac OS X | ~/Library/Logs/SCM-Manager |
| Windows | $BASEDIR\logs |

The location of the **$BASEDIR** can be found [here](basedirectory).
